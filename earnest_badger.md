### Background Context: zkLogin

### Summary

Understand motivation for creation of the zkLogin wallet primitive, consider its use cases.

Key concepts: formal provability of anonymity, implementation details with regards to OpenID, OAuth, JWT.

### Deliverables

- Design and develop a very basic web wallet (as opposed to browser extension). The wallet should use zkLogin and the auth - provider can be limited to Google for the sake of simplicity. The essential features of viewing balances, approving transactions should be implemented in a minimal, visually pleasing UI. Choice of web framework is up to you. 
- Deploy onto Sui testnet. Mainnet optional (let us know if you need wallet dust).
- Provide a project README in Markdown
- In a separate MPC.md document, share your thoughts on how one might build a MPC 2 of 3 escrow wallet solution. No need to implement, we just want a high level feasibility assessment. If you feel this isn't possible, share your reasoning.  
- Share the finished project source code repo link with your referee(s) in Telegram.
- Final online meeting with engineering team members to talk about your proposed solution
